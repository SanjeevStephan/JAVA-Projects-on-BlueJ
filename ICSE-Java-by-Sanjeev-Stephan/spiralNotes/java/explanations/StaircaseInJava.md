This Java program creatively simulates **walking up and down a staircase** while handling **wet and dry steps** using loops and conditional statements.

### Breakdown:
1. **Package Declaration:**
   ```java
   package spiralNote.codes;
   ```
    - Defines the package for the class.

2. **Method Definitions:**
    - **`CleanAndDrySteps()`** â†’ Simulates safely walking **up** a staircase.
    - **`WetAndSlipperySteps()`** â†’ Simulates walking **down** a staircase while **skipping wet steps**.

3. **Clean Staircase (`CleanAndDrySteps`) Logic:**
   ```java
   for( int step = 1; step <= 5; step++) 
   ```
    - Uses a **for loop** to go from step `1` to `5`, printing each step along the way.

4. **Slippery Staircase (`WetAndSlipperySteps`) Logic:**
   ```java
   for( int step = 5; step >= 1 ; step--)
   ```
    - Uses a **reverse for loop** to step down from `5` to `1`.
    - **Skips** wet steps (`step 4` and `step 2`) using:
      ```java
      if(step == 4 || step == 2)  
      {
          System.out.println("Step " + step + " is wet! Skipping");
          continue;
      }
      ```
        - `continue;` **skips the rest of the loopâ€™s iteration**, preventing stepping on wet steps.

5. **Method Execution in `main()`**
   ```java
   CleanAndDrySteps();
   WetAndSlipperySteps();
   ```
    - Calls both methods to simulate **walking up** and **walking down** safely.

### Output:
```
----[ Clean & Dry Staircase ]-----
----[ Going Up the Staircase ]-----
Stepping on step 1
Stepping on step 2
Stepping on step 3
Stepping on step 4
Stepping on step 5
Safely reached the top!

----[ Wet & Slippery Staircase ]-----
----[ Coming down the Staircase ]-----
Stepping on step 5
Step 4 is wet! Skipping
Stepping on step 3
Step 2 is wet! Skipping
Stepping on step 1
Safely reached the floor
```

### Why is this useful?
- Demonstrates **loop iteration** (both increasing and decreasing).
- Shows **conditional skipping** using `continue` in a loop.
- Makes the logic **relatable** and **engaging** by simulating a real-life situation.
