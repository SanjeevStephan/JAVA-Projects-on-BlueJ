Sure! A nested `if` statement in Java is when you place one `if` statement inside another `if` statement. This is useful when you need to check multiple conditions before executing a block of code. Here's an example:

```java
public class NestedIfExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 10;

        if (number > 0) { // Outer if statement
            System.out.println("The number is positive.");

            if (number % 2 == 0) { // Nested if statement
                System.out.println("The number is even.");
            } else {
                System.out.println("The number is odd.");
            }
        } else {
            System.out.println("The number is not positive.");
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. The outer `if` statement checks if `number` is greater than 0.
2. If the condition is true, it prints `"The number is positive."` and then proceeds to the nested `if` statement.
3. The nested `if` statement checks whether `number` is even or odd and prints the appropriate message.
4. If the outer `if` condition is false, it prints `"The number is not positive."`
