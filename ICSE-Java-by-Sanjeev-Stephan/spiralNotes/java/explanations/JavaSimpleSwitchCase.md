This Java program demonstrates the **switch-case** statement, which simplifies conditional logic when checking multiple possible values. Let's break it down:

### **1. Package Declaration**

```java
package spiralNote.java.basics;
```
This line defines the package where this class belongs. Packages help organize related Java classes.

### **2. Class Definition**
```java
public class JavaSimpleSwitchCase
```
Declares a **public** class named `JavaSimpleSwitchCase`.

### **3. Main Method**
```java
public static void main(String[] args)
```
The entry point of the Java program. Execution starts from here.

### **4. Variable Declaration**
```java
int dayNum = 5;
String day = "";
```
- `dayNum` holds the number `5`, which represents a day of the week.
- `day` is an empty string that will be assigned a day name later.

### **5. Switch-Case Logic**
```java
switch(dayNum)
```
The switch statement evaluates `dayNum` and executes the corresponding **case block**.

- If `dayNum == 5`, the **case 5** block executes:
  ```java
  case 5:
      day = "Friday";
      break;
  ```
- The **break** statement ensures only one case executes before exiting the switch block.
- If `dayNum` is outside `0-6`, the **default case** runs:
  ```java
  default :
      day = "Invalid! ";
  ```

### **6. Output Statement**
```java
System.out.println(day);
```
Prints the assigned value of `day`.

### **Expected Output**
Since `dayNum` is `5`, the output will be:
```
Friday
```
If `dayNum` was `3`, it would print `"Wednesday"`. If `dayNum` was `9`, it would print `"Invalid!"`.
